# README

This is the site holding the contents and configuration for generating.

- perl-workflow.github.io / workflow.pm in the perl-workflow.github.io repository

Currently the website is based on [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

The site is generated from the perl-workflow.github.io repo like so:

cd ../perl-workflow.github.io/
mkdocs gh-deploy --config-file ../website/mkdocs.yml --remote-branch main

When deployed, the site is available at:

- [Workflow.om](https://workflow.pm/)

The perl-workflow.github.io repository is a mirror of the website repository and it auto-generated by the mkdocs command above.

Content changes are made in the website repository. Do note the CNAME specification is also in the website repository togehter with the mkdocs configuration file, which 
outlines the website structure and content.

mkdocs documentation available at:

- [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- [mkdocs: deploying your documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/)
